# 3DWriter.io
Use your 3D Printer and a pen to write cursive or block "handwritten" letters

I couldn't find any small programs that i could use to write letters using my 3D Printer as a plotter so i wrote one.
After mucking about with different fonts i found a fontset called the Hershey fonts. These are the only fonts used in this application since they are primarily stroke based fonts rather than outline fonts that every other program i tried had.

Video demo over on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTI48P-svIQ

This is a new version written with HTML5 in mind. There are no downloads, just use it when ever you want for whatever reason.

The original version of this code was written in C# and is on github over here https://github.com/boy1dr/3DWriter

The fonts used here are the Hershey fonts, i did not create them and cannot add your language for you.
I am working on a font editor to enable you to do so, check back for updates.
